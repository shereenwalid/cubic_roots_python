# Cubic equation solver
Welcome to my "Cubic equation solver" this class is made to 
1. Get the roots of a cubic function using Cardano's formula.
2. Plot the cubic equation

# Project Motivation
I created this class to make it simpler to take an instance of it and use it right away,
since I was driven to discover a simpler method for solving and plotting cubic equations.

# Main Files
1. Cubic_equation_solver.py include the class with the necessary functions

# Libraries Used
